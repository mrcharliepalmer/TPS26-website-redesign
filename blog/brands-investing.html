          <div class="blog-article__body">

            <p>Podcast advertising has moved from experimental line item to core media strategy for the world's biggest brands. The numbers tell part of the story — global ad revenue has grown consistently year on year, and forecasts suggest that growth is accelerating, not slowing.</p>

            <p>But the real reason brands are investing isn't just scale. It's the quality of the attention they're buying.</p>

            <h2>The Attention Advantage</h2>

            <p>In a media landscape defined by scroll speed and skip buttons, podcasts are an outlier. Listeners choose to press play. They typically listen for 30 minutes or more. And they're engaged in a way that most digital channels simply can't match.</p>

            <p>Host-read ads, where the presenter endorses a product in their own words, consistently outperform other digital ad formats for brand recall, trust, and purchase intent. That's because the endorsement inherits the relationship between the host and the listener — a relationship that's been built over hundreds of hours of content.</p>

            <p>Even as programmatic podcast advertising has grown (making it easier for brands to buy inventory at scale), host-read remains the premium format because it works.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the Ad Read</h2>

            <p>The smartest brand strategies in podcasting go well beyond a 30-second spot. Branded podcasts — shows created by or for a brand — have become a legitimate content format. When done well, they provide genuine value to the listener while building brand affinity over time.</p>

            <p>Sponsorship of existing shows offers a middle ground: the brand gets association with content the audience already trusts, without having to produce anything from scratch.</p>

            <p>And then there's live. Podcast live events, recordings, and festival activations give brands a physical presence in a medium that's traditionally been invisible. The Podcast Show itself is a case study: 100+ exhibiting companies, from Canon to Spotify, using the floor to reach 10,000+ decision-makers in one space.</p>

            <h2>Who's in the Room</h2>

            <p>This is where The Podcast Show's audience mix becomes relevant. In 2025, 1,042 brand advertisers and media agencies attended TPS. They were alongside 2,391 podcast creators and producers, and 100+ platform and technology companies.</p>

            <blockquote class="blog-pullquote">
              <p>1,042 brand advertisers and media agencies attended TPS in 2025. That concentration of decision-makers doesn't exist anywhere else in podcasting.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>That concentration matters. If you're a media buyer, you can meet podcast sales teams, independent creators, and tech vendors in the same building on the same day. If you're a brand marketer, you can hear directly from the creators your audience already listens to — and from the platforms that can help you reach them.</p>

            <p>The Brand Works Stage (run with IAB UK and Sounds Profitable) dedicates an entire stage to advertising: measurement, ROI, case studies, format innovation, and what's actually converting. It's two days of content specifically designed for brand-side and agency professionals.</p>

            <h2>TPS Connects</h2>

            <p>New for 2026, TPS Connects is a curated networking programme that matches brands with podcast communities. It's structured around actual introductions, not just hope-for-the-best networking over coffee. If you're looking for the right creators or podcasts to partner with, this is designed to make those connections happen efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <p>For brands new to podcast advertising, TPS is the most efficient way to get up to speed. Two days on the floor will give you more market understanding than months of desk research. You'll hear what's working from the people spending the budgets, meet the platforms that can execute campaigns, and get a clear picture of where the opportunity sits for your brand and sector.</p>

            <p>For brands already active in the space, TPS is where you go deeper: new formats, better measurement, stronger creator relationships, and the kind of strategic conversations that only happen when the whole industry is in one room.</p>

            <h2>Partnership and Exhibition</h2>

            <p>Beyond attending, brands can <a href="../partners.html">partner with or exhibit at The Podcast Show</a>. Partnership tiers range from Headline and Official Partner down to Show Partner and Exhibitor, with options including stage sponsorship, stand space, branded activations, and curated networking access.</p>

            <p>95% of exhibition space for 2026 is already sold. If you're considering a presence on the floor, the time to <a href="../partners.html#enquire">enquire is now</a>.</p>
