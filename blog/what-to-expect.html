            <p>The Podcast Show London is the biggest international festival for the business of podcasting. It takes place on 20–21 May 2026 at the Business Design Centre in Islington, London, and brings together over 10,000 attendees from 53 countries for two days of keynotes, panels, workshops, networking, deals, and evening events.</p>

            <p>If you work in podcasting — or want to — this is where the industry meets every year.</p>

            <h2>The Basics</h2>

            <p>Two days. Eight stages. More than 170 sessions and 450 speakers. An exhibition floor with 100+ companies. And a night programme that extends from the venue into some of London's best spaces.</p>

            <p>The festival runs from 9am to 6pm each day, with registration opening at 8:30am. The Business Design Centre is a five-minute walk from Angel station on the Northern Line, and it's an easy venue to navigate once you're inside — all eight stages and the exhibition are under one roof.</p>

            <p>Passes range from Silver (sold out for 2026) through Gold (one-day and two-day options) to Platinum, which includes fast-track entry, premium seating, and access to exclusive networking events including the Leaders in Podcasting Breakfast and the Official Party. <a href="../passes.html">Second Release pricing is available now</a>.</p>

            <h2>Who Attends</h2>

            <p>The mix is what makes TPS different from other industry events. In 2025, the floor was roughly split between three groups: podcast creators and producers (2,391), brand advertisers and media agencies (1,042), and platform and technology companies (100+ exhibiting). Add in press, academics, and curious newcomers, and you get a room that genuinely represents the full ecosystem.</p>

            <p>That balance is deliberate. TPS isn't a creator convention or a media buyer summit — it's the one place where all three sides of the industry are in the same building at the same time.</p>

            <h2>The Programme</h2>

            <p>The eight stages cover different angles of the industry, from flagship keynotes on the Origin Theatre to hands-on creator sessions on the Creator Stage and deep dives into advertising on the Brand Works Stage (run with IAB UK and Sounds Profitable). The International Stage, powered by Podimo, focuses on global market discussions. Two Talking Podcasts stages host more intimate conversations and professional tips.</p>

            <p>Previous speakers have included Louis Theroux, James Corden, Fearne Cotton, Gary Lineker, Ashley Flowers, MrBallen, GK Barry, and Mo Gilligan — alongside hundreds of industry professionals, platform leads, and independent creators.</p>

            <p>The 2026 programme will be announced in the coming months, but based on the 2025 edition, expect a mix of big-name interviews, practical how-to sessions, market analysis, and honest conversations about what's working (and what isn't) in the industry right now.</p>

            <h2>New for 2026</h2>

            <p>Four new additions are confirmed for this year:</p>

            <p>The Creator Mix is an evening networking party for 1,000+ podcast creators on Day 1. It's designed as a proper social event — not a panel with drinks bolted on.</p>

            <p>The International Stage, powered by Podimo, gets its own dedicated space for global podcast market discussions.</p>

            <p>TPS Connects is a curated networking programme matching brands with podcast communities. If you're a brand looking for the right creators, or a creator looking for commercial partnerships, this is where those conversations happen.</p>

            <p>The Creator First Stage, in association with Arcade, focuses on the creator economy — ownership, distribution, and building businesses around content.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the Stages</h2>

            <p>The exhibition floor is a major part of the experience. Over 100 companies set up, from major platforms (Spotify, Amazon Music, Acast) to recording equipment brands, hosting platforms, and production studios. The Creator Village offers hands-on production demos, and Ask The Experts (with BetterHelp) provides one-to-one guidance sessions.</p>

            <p>Then there's the night programme. The Official Party takes place at an exclusive London venue. Live podcast recordings happen at iconic spaces across the city (produced with AEG Presents). Executive dinners bring together senior industry figures. And partner receptions offer more intimate networking throughout the evenings.</p>

            <h2>Is It Worth It?</h2>

            <p>The honest answer: if you're serious about podcasting as a business — whether you're making podcasts, selling ads against them, or building the technology that powers them — there isn't a comparable event anywhere in the world.</p>

            <blockquote class="blog-pullquote">
              <p>Two days where the entire industry is in one building. You can't afford to miss it.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><a href="../passes.html">Second Release passes are on sale now</a>. Prices go up at the next release, and Silver is already sold out.</p>
